// DOS --> Deniel of service
// DDOS --> Destributed Deniel of service

// when a server is busy and serve greater number of requests, then it denied other requests -->DOS

// Brute force attack--> hacker tries combinations of email or passwords until login 



//symmetric algorithms

not easy to rotate 
secret has to be shared with microservice and servers
any one can issue jwt if secret key is leaked
ckient side verfication not possible because we cant store secret key to client 





// rs256

two keys 1.sign the token 2.one is to validate the token(verify)

10-100 times more security


client request login then jwt is signed using pk
and for microservices and severs we use public key to verify the token


openssl genrsa -out private.pem 3072(bit)
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
